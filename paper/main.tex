We present SolidAuth, a decentralized authentication gateway that bridges the gap between Solid-OIDC's user-controlled identity model and the developer experience expected from modern authentication services. 
While existing solutions like Auth0 and Okta provide excellent developer experience, they centralize user identity data. 
Conversely, Solid offers user sovereignty but lacks the ease of integration developers expect.
Our system demonstrates that decentralized authentication can achieve performance parity with centralized services while maintaining user data sovereignty.
Through comprehensive evaluation including performance benchmarks, security analysis, and developer usability studies, we show that SolidAuth achieves sub-500ms authentication latency, handles 1000+ requests/second, and enables integration in under 2 hours.
This work contributes: (1) the first Auth0-like gateway for Solid-OIDC, (2) formal verification of authentication flows, (3) empirical evidence of viability for production deployment.
