# Solid Federated Auth Research Project

## Project Overview
This is an academic research project aimed at developing and evaluating a decentralized authentication gateway using Solid-OIDC protocol. The goal is to create a system that matches the developer experience of Auth0/Okta while maintaining user sovereignty, suitable for publication on ArXiv.

## Research Question
**Can decentralized identity systems achieve the same developer experience and performance as centralized authentication services while maintaining user sovereignty?**

## Research Agents

### 1. Literature Review Agent
**Purpose**: Survey and analyze existing work on decentralized identity, Solid, and authentication systems.

**Tasks**:
- Search ArXiv for papers on Solid, WebID, decentralized identity
- Analyze Auth0/Okta alternatives and their limitations
- Identify gaps in current research
- Maintain bibliography in `/research/literature/`

**Prompts**:
```
Search for recent papers on [TOPIC] in ArXiv and academic databases.
Summarize the key contributions and limitations of each paper.
Identify how our work differs from existing solutions.
```

### 2. Experiment Design Agent
**Purpose**: Design rigorous experiments to evaluate the system.

**Tasks**:

- Design security evaluation scenarios
- Develop usability metrics
- Define comparison methodology with Auth0/Keycloak

**Metrics to Track**:
- Authentication latency (ms)
- Throughput (requests/second)
- Integration time (developer hours)
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- User satisfaction score

### 3. Implementation Agent
**Purpose**: Guide the technical implementation of the authentication gateway.
