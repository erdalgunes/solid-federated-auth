# Solid Federated Auth Research Project

## ðŸ§  Session Context (Start Here)

**If you're a new Claude session, here's what you need to know:**

You're working on **SolidAuth** - an academic research project creating a decentralized authentication gateway. Think Auth0, but with user-controlled identity via Solid-OIDC.

### CRITICAL: First Commands for New Session
```bash
# 1. Check for checkpoint from previous session
cat CHECKPOINT.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No checkpoint found"

# 2. Check what needs to be done
gh issue list --repo erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth --state open

# 3. See recent work
git log --oneline -5

# 4. Read context preservation protocol
cat CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md  # IMPORTANT: Explains how to prevent context degradation
```

### Context Preservation Rules
**IMPORTANT**: Claude has limited context window. To prevent degradation and hallucinations:
1. **Work in 30-minute chunks** - Set a timer, checkpoint at 30 mins
2. **One issue per session** - NEVER work on multiple issues
3. **Verify all research** - Use `tavily` to confirm papers/citations exist
4. **Use sequential thinking** - For complex reasoning, use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`
5. **Checkpoint frequently** - Update CHECKPOINT.md and commit every 30 minutes

### Quick Orientation Commands
```bash
# 1. Check what needs to be done
gh issue list --repo erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth --state open

# 2. See project board status  
gh project item-list 3 --owner erdalgunes

# 3. View current research phase
gh issue list --milestone "Phase 1: Literature Review"

# 4. Pick an issue to work on
gh issue develop [NUMBER]  # Creates branch and checks out
```

### Current Status Check
1. **Checkpoint**: First check `CHECKPOINT.md` for work in progress
2. **Phase**: Check milestones with `gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/milestones`
3. **Active Issues**: Use commands above
4. **Repository State**: Check git status and recent commits
5. **Documentation**: Key files are README.md (overview), RESEARCH_PLAN.md (methodology), ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md (how we work), CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md (context preservation)

### How to Continue Work
1. **ALWAYS** check CHECKPOINT.md first
2. Read any open issue to understand current tasks
3. Check ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md for the GitHub-based research workflow
4. Use the research agents defined below for specific tasks
5. Follow the established patterns in existing code/docs
6. **Set 30-minute timer** and checkpoint when it rings

### Key Principles
- Simple, working solutions over complex abstractions (YAGNI-first)
- Issue-driven development (every task has an issue)
- Rigorous documentation for reproducibility
- Academic standards for ArXiv publication
- **Verify everything** - Never trust memory, always verify with Tavily

### Tool Usage Guidelines

#### GitHub CLI (`gh` via Bash) - PRIMARY INTERFACE
**We use GitHub CLI for ALL GitHub operations:**
```bash
# Issues
gh issue list --state open                    # See what needs work
gh issue view [NUMBER]                        # Read issue details
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."    # Create new issue
gh issue close [NUMBER] -c "Done"            # Close with comment
gh issue develop [NUMBER]                     # Create branch for issue

# Projects  
gh project item-list 3 --owner erdalgunes     # View project board
gh project item-add 3 --owner erdalgunes --url [ISSUE_URL]

# Pull Requests
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."       # Create PR
gh pr list                                    # List PRs
gh pr merge                                   # Merge PR

# Repository
gh repo view                                  # See repo info
gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/milestones

# Wiki (if needed)
gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/wiki
```

#### When to use Sequential Thinking (`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`)
- Planning complex implementations
- Analyzing multi-step problems
- Designing protocols or architectures
- Reasoning through trade-offs
- Preventing context degradation in long tasks
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning for research**

#### When to use Tavily (`mcp__tavily-mcp__tavily-search` or `tavily-extract`)
- Verifying paper citations exist
- Checking latest documentation
- Confirming technical specifications
- Researching best practices
- Finding recent developments
- **ALWAYS** before committing research findings
- **Web access for current information**

#### When to use TodoWrite
- Starting any new issue
- Breaking down complex tasks
- Tracking progress through work
- Must mark items complete as you go
- Clean up stale todos regularly

## Project Overview
This is an academic research project aimed at developing and evaluating a decentralized authentication gateway using Solid-OIDC protocol. The goal is to create a system that matches the developer experience of Auth0/Okta while maintaining user sovereignty, suitable for publication on ArXiv.

## Research Question
**Can decentralized identity systems achieve the same developer experience and performance as centralized authentication services while maintaining user sovereignty?**
