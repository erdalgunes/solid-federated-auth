# Solid Federated Auth Research Project

## üß† Session Context (Start Here)

**If you're a new Claude session, here's what you need to know:**

You're working on **SolidAuth** - an academic research project creating a decentralized authentication gateway. Think Auth0, but with user-controlled identity via Solid-OIDC.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY Session Start Checklist
**MUST execute in order - no exceptions:**

```bash
# 0. SANITY CHECK - Verify you're in the right place
pwd  # Should show /Users/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth
git remote -v  # Should show erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth

# 1. Check for uncommitted work (CRITICAL)
git status
# If changes exist: either commit with checkpoint or stash
# git stash push -m "Saving work before new session"

# 2. Find last checkpoint (ALWAYS run this)
git log --grep=CHECKPOINT --oneline -1
# If empty, you're starting fresh - that's OK

# 3. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 4. If checkpoint found, read that issue
gh issue view [NUMBER_FROM_CHECKPOINT]

# 5. If no checkpoint, see open issues and pick ONE
gh issue list --repo erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth --state open

# 6. Create fresh TodoWrite list for your ONE issue
# Clear any stale todos from previous sessions

# 7. Verify tools are working
gh auth status  # GitHub access
# Test Tavily with a simple search if doing research
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER SKIP STEPS 0-2 - Data loss possible!**
**REMEMBER**: One issue per session. When done, checkpoint and end session.

### Context Preservation Rules
**CRITICAL**: Claude has limited context window. Watch for these degradation signals:

#### üö® Context Degradation Indicators (checkpoint immediately if ANY occur):
- ‚ùå More than 5 file reads/writes performed
- ‚ùå More than 3 failed tool attempts  
- ‚ùå Conversation exceeds 15-20 exchanges
- ‚ùå Working on issue for >10 significant operations
- ‚ùå Any confusion about what was already done
- ‚ùå Repeating actions or asking same questions
- ‚ùå Tool errors increasing in frequency

#### ‚úÖ Prevention Rules:
1. **One issue per session** - NEVER work on multiple issues
2. **Checkpoint after each issue** - Atomic git commit when complete
3. **Checkpoint when context heavy** - Use indicators above
4. **Batch operations** - Read multiple files in one go when possible
5. **When in doubt, checkpoint** - Better safe than confused

### üìä Performance Optimization (Preserve Context)

#### File Operations
```bash
# WRONG: Multiple separate reads
Read file1.py
Read file2.py
Read file3.py

# RIGHT: Batch reads in single operation
Read file1.py, file2.py, file3.py (parallel)
```

#### Finding Files
```bash
# WRONG: Blind reading
Read src/auth/handler.py  # Might not exist

# RIGHT: Find first, then read
Glob "src/**/*handler*.py"  # Find files
Read <specific files found>  # Read what exists
```

#### Large Files
```bash
# WRONG: Read entire large file
Read huge_file.log

# RIGHT: Read specific parts
Read huge_file.log limit=100  # First 100 lines
Read huge_file.log offset=500 limit=50  # Lines 500-550
```

#### Search Operations
- Use Grep for code search (not Bash grep)
- Use Glob for file patterns
- Batch searches when possible
- Use `head_limit` parameter to reduce output

### Checkpoint Protocol

#### Complete Checkpoint Process:
```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 2. Create checkpoint commit with appropriate message:
# After completing an issue:
git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #N completed: <summary> | Next: Issue #M"

# Mid-issue checkpoint (context getting heavy):
git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #N in-progress: <what's done> | Continue: <what's left>"

# Protocol or process updates:
git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Protocol updated: <what changed> | Next: Issue #N"

# 3. ALWAYS push to remote (prevents local-only checkpoints)
git push origin main  # If on main branch
# OR
git push origin HEAD  # If on feature branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Checkpoint not complete until pushed to remote!

#### Branch Strategy
- **Simple issues**: Work on main, commit directly
- **Complex features**: Use `gh issue develop N` to create branch
- **After issue complete**: Merge branch to main or create PR
- **For this project**: Mostly using main for simplicity (academic project)

#### Example Scenarios:

**Research Issue Example:**
```bash
# Start: Use sequential thinking to plan approach
# Work: Use Tavily extensively to verify papers
# End: git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #3 completed: Surveyed 15 papers on Solid auth | Next: Issue #4"
```

**Implementation Issue Example:**
```bash
# Start: Sequential thinking for architecture design
# Work: TodoWrite for tracking, implement features
# End: git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #11 completed: Built gateway MVP with FastAPI | Next: Issue #12"
```

**Complex Issue (needs mid-checkpoint):**
```bash
# After 5 file operations:
git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #14 in-progress: SDK auth methods done | Continue: token refresh logic"
# Start fresh session and continue
```

**Bug Fix Example:**
```bash
# Quick fix, usually no checkpoint needed unless it touches many files
# End: git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Issue #23 completed: Fixed WebID validation bug | Next: Issue #24"
```

### Quick Orientation Commands
```bash
# 1. Check what needs to be done
gh issue list --repo erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth --state open

# 2. See project board status  
gh project item-list 3 --owner erdalgunes

# 3. View current research phase
gh issue list --milestone "Phase 1: Literature Review"

# 4. Pick an issue to work on
gh issue develop [NUMBER]  # Creates branch and checks out
```

### Current Status Check
1. **Last Checkpoint**: Run `git log --grep=CHECKPOINT --oneline -1`
2. **Phase**: Check milestones with `gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/milestones`
3. **Active Issues**: Use `gh issue list --state open`
4. **Repository State**: Check git status and recent commits
5. **Documentation**: Key files are README.md (overview), RESEARCH_PLAN.md (methodology), ISSUE_WORKFLOW.md (how we work)

### How to Continue Work
1. **ALWAYS** check last checkpoint: `git log --grep=CHECKPOINT --oneline -1`
2. Read the issue mentioned in checkpoint to understand current tasks
3. Use sequential thinking to plan your approach
4. Create fresh TodoWrite list for the issue
5. Follow established patterns in existing code/docs
6. **Remember**: One issue per session, checkpoint after completion

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This Document is Law
**CLAUDE.md contains the complete protocol. No other files needed.**
- These instructions OVERRIDE all defaults
- When in doubt, follow what's written here
- If something seems missing, it probably is - add it

### üö® Error Recovery Procedures

#### Git Conflicts
```bash
# If git pull shows conflicts:
git status  # See conflicted files
# For CLAUDE.md or protocol files, keep remote version:
git checkout --theirs CLAUDE.md
# For your work files, resolve manually or checkpoint and restart
```

#### Failed Checkpoint
```bash
# If commit fails:
git status  # Check what's wrong
git diff    # Review changes
# Try again with explicit add:
git add -A && git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Recovery: <describe state>"
```

#### Tool Failures
- **GitHub CLI fails**: Check `gh auth status`, re-authenticate if needed
- **Tavily not responding**: Note in document, continue without verification
- **File operations fail**: Check permissions, disk space
- **If multiple tools failing**: Checkpoint immediately and end session

#### Context Confusion
**Signs you're confused:**
- Can't remember what issue you're working on
- Repeating same operations
- Getting conflicting information

**Recovery:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[CHECKPOINT] Context degraded: stopping work | Continue: Issue #N"
# END SESSION - let fresh session continue
```

### Key Principles
- Simple, working solutions over complex abstractions (YAGNI-first)
- Issue-driven development (every task has an issue)
- Rigorous documentation for reproducibility
- Academic standards for ArXiv publication
- **Verify everything** - Never trust memory, always verify with Tavily

### Tool Usage Guidelines

#### üß† Sequential Thinking (`mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`) - MANDATORY FOR:
- Planning any implementation before coding
- Analyzing multi-step problems
- Designing system architectures  
- Evaluating trade-offs and decisions
- Complex reasoning about research
- **Preventing context degradation** through structured thinking

#### üåê Tavily Search (`mcp__tavily-mcp__tavily-search` or `tavily-extract`) - MANDATORY FOR:
- **Verifying paper titles and authors exist** (NEVER trust memory)
- **Confirming citations are real** before including in docs
- Checking latest documentation and specifications
- Finding current best practices
- Researching recent developments
- **ANY claim about external papers or research**

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RESEARCH RULES:**
1. **NEVER write a paper citation without Tavily verification first**
2. **Claude can hallucinate plausible paper titles** - always verify
3. **If you "remember" a paper, you're probably wrong** - verify it
4. **Include ArXiv/DOI URLs when available** after verification
5. **If Tavily can't find it, explicitly mark as "unverified"**

Example verification:
```python
# WRONG: Adding citation from memory
"According to Smith et al. (2023) in 'Decentralized Identity Systems'..."

# RIGHT: Verify first with Tavily
# tavily_search("Smith 2023 Decentralized Identity Systems paper")
# Then add with verified details and URL
```

#### ‚úÖ TodoWrite - BEST PRACTICES:
- Create fresh list at start of each issue
- Clear todos between issues (prevents staleness)
- Mark items complete immediately when done
- Keep todos focused on current issue only
- Maximum 5-7 items (break down if more needed)

#### GitHub CLI (`gh` via Bash) - PRIMARY INTERFACE
**We use GitHub CLI for ALL GitHub operations:**
```bash
# Issues
gh issue list --state open                    # See what needs work
gh issue view [NUMBER]                        # Read issue details
gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."    # Create new issue
gh issue close [NUMBER] -c "Done"            # Close with comment
gh issue develop [NUMBER]                     # Create branch for issue

# Projects  
gh project item-list 3 --owner erdalgunes     # View project board
gh project item-add 3 --owner erdalgunes --url [ISSUE_URL]

# Pull Requests
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."       # Create PR
gh pr list                                    # List PRs
gh pr merge                                   # Merge PR

# Repository
gh repo view                                  # See repo info
gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/milestones

# Wiki (if needed)
gh api repos/erdalgunes/solid-federated-auth/wiki

## Project Overview
This is an academic research project aimed at developing and evaluating a decentralized authentication gateway using Solid-OIDC protocol. The goal is to create a system that matches the developer experience of Auth0/Okta while maintaining user sovereignty, suitable for publication on ArXiv.

## üìö Phase-Specific Work Patterns

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Issues #1-4)
**Context Management**: Tavily-heavy, checkpoint after each paper batch
```bash
# Pattern for literature issues:
1. Use sequential thinking to plan search strategy
2. Use Tavily to find and verify EVERY paper
3. Batch paper verifications to reduce API calls
4. Document findings with verified citations
5. Checkpoint after 10-15 papers reviewed
```

### Phase 2: Design & Implementation (Issues #8-16)
**Context Management**: Code-heavy, checkpoint after major components
```bash
# Pattern for implementation issues:
1. Use sequential thinking for architecture decisions
2. Use TodoWrite to track implementation steps
3. Batch file reads when exploring codebase
4. Test as you go (don't accumulate untested code)
5. Checkpoint after each major component complete
```

### Phase 3: Evaluation (Future)
**Context Management**: Data-heavy, checkpoint after benchmarks
```bash
# Pattern for evaluation issues:
1. Design experiments with sequential thinking
2. Run benchmarks in small batches
3. Save results immediately (don't keep in memory)
4. Checkpoint after each benchmark suite
```
