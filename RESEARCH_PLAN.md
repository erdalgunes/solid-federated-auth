# Research Plan: Decentralized Authentication Gateway for Solid-OIDC

## Executive Summary
This research investigates whether decentralized identity systems can achieve parity with centralized authentication services in terms of developer experience and performance while maintaining user sovereignty. We propose SolidAuth, a novel authentication gateway that bridges Solid-OIDC's decentralized identity model with the ease-of-use expected from services like Auth0.

## 1. Research Objectives

### Primary Research Question
**RQ1**: Can a decentralized authentication gateway based on Solid-OIDC match the performance and developer experience of centralized authentication services while providing superior privacy guarantees?

### Secondary Research Questions
- **RQ2**: What are the performance trade-offs between decentralized and centralized authentication systems?
- **RQ3**: How does the security model of Solid-OIDC compare to traditional OAuth 2.0 implementations?
- **RQ4**: What architectural patterns best support scalable decentralized authentication?
- **RQ5**: How do developers perceive the complexity of integrating decentralized vs. centralized auth?

## 2. Hypotheses

### H1: Performance Parity
A properly optimized Solid-OIDC gateway can achieve authentication latency within 20% of Auth0's performance.

### H2: Developer Experience
With appropriate SDKs and documentation, developers can integrate Solid-OIDC authentication in comparable time to Auth0 (< 2 hours).

### H3: Security Enhancement
The decentralized model provides measurably better privacy properties without sacrificing security.

### H4: Scalability
The system can handle 10,000+ concurrent authenticated sessions with 99.9% availability.
