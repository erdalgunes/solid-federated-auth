# Session Checkpoint

## Current Issue: #4
**Title**: [LITERATURE] Study formal verification methods for authentication protocols
**Started**: 2024-12-30 14:30
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30 15:00

## Session Timer
⏰ **Next Checkpoint**: 15:30 (30 minutes from start)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Researched ProVerif capabilities (verified with Tavily)
- [x] Found 3 papers on OAuth formal verification
- [x] Updated FORMAL_VERIFICATION_METHODS.md with findings
- [ ] Add Tamarin comparison
- [ ] Create example ProVerif model

## Verified Citations
1. ✅ Fett, Küsters, Schmitz (2016) - "A Comprehensive Formal Security Analysis of OAuth 2.0"
   - Verified via Tavily search
   - Added to LITERATURE_REVIEW.md
2. ✅ Blanchet (2016) - "Modeling and Verifying Security Protocols with ProVerif"
   - ArXiv:1608.05061 confirmed to exist
3. ⚠️ NEED TO VERIFY: "OAuth 2.1 Formal Analysis" (2023)
   - Could not find with Tavily, may be hallucinated

## Key Findings
- ProVerif best for automated verification
- Tamarin better for state-based properties
- Most OAuth analysis uses Dolev-Yao model
- PKCE verification done in 2019 paper

## Code/Files Modified
- `/research/literature/FORMAL_VERIFICATION_METHODS.md` - Added sections 3-5
- `/research/literature/VERIFIABLE_PROPERTIES.md` - Completed

## Next Steps
1. Verify the 2023 OAuth paper citation with Tavily
2. Add Tamarin comparison section
3. Create simple ProVerif example
4. Close issue #4 after review

## Context Warnings
⚠️ Getting close to 30-minute mark - prepare to checkpoint
⚠️ Remember YAGNI - don't create ProVerif framework, just example

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Continue from here:
gh issue view 4
cat CHECKPOINT.md
git diff HEAD~1  # See what was changed
# Then continue with "Next Steps" above
