# SolidAuth: A Decentralized Authentication Gateway for Solid-OIDC

**An Academic Research Project for ArXiv Publication**

A universal authentication system built on the Solid-OIDC protocol, providing decentralized, user-controlled identity management that matches the developer experience of Auth0 while maintaining complete user data sovereignty.

## 📚 Research Context

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation framework for our research on bridging the gap between decentralized identity systems and practical authentication services. Our work addresses the fundamental question: **Can decentralized authentication achieve parity with centralized services in performance and developer experience?**

### Research Contributions
1. **Novel Architecture**: First Auth0-like gateway for Solid-OIDC protocol
2. **Performance Analysis**: Comprehensive benchmarks against commercial services
3. **Security Verification**: Formal ProVerif models of authentication flows
4. **Developer Study**: Empirical evaluation of integration complexity

## 🎯 Vision

Create an authentication service where:
- Users own their identity data in Solid Pods
- Applications can authenticate users without storing credentials
- Identity is portable across any compatible service
- Privacy and user control are fundamental, not features

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Decentralized Identity**: Users control their WebID and data
- **OAuth 2.0 + OIDC**: Industry-standard authentication flows
- **Federated by Design**: Works with any Solid Pod provider
- **Zero Lock-in**: Users can switch providers anytime
- **Privacy-First**: Minimal data sharing, user consent required
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any application type

## 📋 Use Cases

### For Applications
- **SaaS Platforms**: Authenticate users without managing passwords
- **Enterprise Apps**: Single sign-on with employee-controlled identity
- **Developer Tools**: GitHub/GitLab alternative auth
- **E-commerce**: Portable customer profiles across platforms
- **Healthcare**: Patient-controlled medical identity
- **Government Services**: Citizen identity verification

### For Users
- One identity for all services
- Complete control over personal data
- No more password management
- Choose your identity provider
- Revoke access anytime

## 🏗️ Architecture

This system implements:
- **Solid-OIDC Protocol**: Extension of OpenID Connect for Solid
- **WebID**: Decentralized identity URLs
- **DPoP**: Proof-of-possession for enhanced security
- **Solid Pods**: Personal data storage

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

## 🔧 Integration

### Quick Start for Applications

```javascript
import { login } from '@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser';

// Authenticate a user
await login({
  oidcIssuer: 'https://solidcommunity.net',
  redirectUrl: window.location.href,
  clientName: 'My Application'
});
```

See [INTEGRATION.md](./INTEGRATION.md) for complete integration guide.
