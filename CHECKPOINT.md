# Checkpoint - Issue #4: Formal Verification Methods

## Current Issue: #4
**Title**: [LITERATURE] Study formal verification methods for authentication protocols

## Session: 2024-12-30 21:00 UTC

## Completed Tasks:
- [x] Research ProVerif documentation and examples
- [x] Find papers on formal verification of OAuth/OIDC protocols  
- [x] Study BAN logic and authentication applications
- [x] Collect security protocol verification papers
- [x] Research TLA+ for distributed systems verification
- [x] Create summary of formal verification approaches
- [x] Document list of verifiable properties
- [x] Organize example models from literature
- [x] Write ProVerif tutorial/guide
- [x] Justify tool selection for our analysis

## Key Findings:

### 1. Tool Selection
- **Primary Tool: ProVerif** - Best for OAuth/OIDC with automated verification
- **Secondary: Tamarin** - For state-based properties
- **Auxiliary: TLA+** - For distributed system aspects
- **BAN Logic** - Historical importance but largely superseded

### 2. Existing OAuth/OIDC Formal Work
- Fett, KÃ¼sters, Schmitz (2016) - Comprehensive OAuth 2.0 analysis (ArXiv:1601.01229)
- WebSpi library provides reusable OAuth models
- OIDC formal analysis (ArXiv:1704.08539) found 11 attack vectors
- PKCE verification proved effective with Tamarin

### 3. Verifiable Properties Identified
- **Critical**: Token secrecy, authentication, CSRF protection
- **High Priority**: Scope enforcement, session binding, token lifecycle
- **Solid-Specific**: WebID authentication, pod access control, decentralization

### 4. Documents Created/Updated
- `FORMAL_VERIFICATION_METHODS.md` - Comprehensive survey (587 lines)
- `VERIFIABLE_PROPERTIES.md` - Complete property list (359 lines)
- `PROVERIF_EXAMPLES.md` - OAuth/OIDC ProVerif models (564 lines)
- `PROVERIF_TUTORIAL.md` - Step-by-step guide (newly created)

## Next Steps:
1. Close Issue #4 as completed
2. Consider creating new issues for Phase 2:
   - Install and setup ProVerif environment
   - Create initial Solid-OIDC ProVerif model
   - Define formal security properties for verification
   - Run initial verification experiments

## Notes:
- All research properly documented with verified citations
- ProVerif examples ready for adaptation to Solid-OIDC
- Tutorial provides clear path for team members to learn ProVerif
- Tool selection justified based on OAuth/OIDC support and automation

## Time Spent: ~30 minutes
